As tea leaves unravel and coffee patiently drips, it is the best representation of the making of tea and coffee.

    "Over time, we saw others trying to cut corners, and we vowed to work harder to make food that you can trust. As GMOâ€™s, MSG, fillers, sweeteners and irradiation became increasingly common elsewhere, we deepened our commitment to our customers and to the planet. By 2007, we achieved our 100% Organic Certification, and in the following months we increased our line to include Certified Fair Trade, Kosher, Vegan, and Gluten Free products. In 2012, we developed a line of EcoShakers, a spice container that is 100% recyclable.",
