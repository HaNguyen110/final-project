        text="Over time, we saw others trying to cut corners, and we vowed to work 
        harder to make food that you can trust. As GMOâ€™s, MSG, fillers, sweeteners 
        and irradiation became increasingly common elsewhere, we deepened our commitment 
        to our customers and to the planet. By 2007, we achieved our 100% Organic 
        Certification, and in the following months we increased our line to include 
        Certified Fair Trade, Kosher, Vegan, and Gluten Free products. In 2012, we 
        developed a line of EcoShakers, a spice container that is 100% recyclable."

        text="We import 100% organic spices using Fair Trade options whenever available. 
        All imported spices are required to go through a sterilization process before 
        being sold in the United States. Most spice companies sterilize using synthetic 
        chemicals or radiation. Spicely Organics uses a process called steam sterilization, 
        which sterilizes food products without adding any chemicals or hazardous materials."
        comment="Worldwide, we have over 50 passionate employees and counting. In 2012, we 
        opened our first ever Spicely Boutique, located in downtown San Francisco."
